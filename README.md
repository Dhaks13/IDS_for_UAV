## Abstract:
The escalating deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles for significant functions has
rendered them increasingly susceptible to cybersecurity vulnerabilities, such as Global
Positioning System(GPS) spoofing and Denial of Service(Dos) assaults, which possess the
potential to undermine essential operational activities. To address this, a security framework
is designed to detect intrusions. Intrusion Detection System uses supervised machine
learning(ML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to provide effective threat detection.
To work efficiently with limited resources, techniques such as selecting the most important
features and handling imbalanced data with the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
(SMOTE) are used. Randomized search cross-validation (RSCV) aids in selecting optimal
hyperparameters for model training. The Models like Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT),
Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), Adaptive Boosting(AdaBoost) and logistic regression (LR) are
to be trained and tested on real-world datasets, such as GPS spoofing and wireless sensor
network attacks. These models are to be compared and the result aims for the best
performance, with high accuracy, low false alarms, and minimal computational requirements.
Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis was used to explain the model’s predictions,
making it more trustworthy.
